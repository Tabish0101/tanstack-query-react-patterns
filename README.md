# 🚀 React API Integration Best Practices  
**TanStack Query + Axios**

A hands-on React project focused on **production-ready API integration patterns** using **TanStack Query** and **Axios**.  
This repository demonstrates how modern React applications should handle **server state, API abstraction, caching, loading & error states**, and **scalable architecture**.

## 👀 Why This Project Exists

Many React projects fetch data incorrectly — mixing concerns, ignoring caching, and handling loading/error states poorly.

This project exists to:

- Learn how APIs are handled in **real-world React applications**
- Practice **clean and scalable architecture**
- Demonstrate **industry-standard patterns** to recruiters
